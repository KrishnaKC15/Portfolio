# 🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my **second web development project**, built entirely using **HTML and CSS** — no JavaScript used.

It is a simple yet elegant personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and background. This project helped me further improve my understanding of layout structuring, styling, and responsive design.
